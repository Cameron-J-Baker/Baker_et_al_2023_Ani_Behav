We supply the R code that was used in the data analysis and preparation of the manuscript "Long-term tracking reveals a dynamic crocodylian social system" which has been accepted for publication at the journal Animal Behaviour. 

The raw data supporting this publication can be sourced from the Acoustic Animal Tracking Database (https://animaltracking.aodn.org.au) of the Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS, www.imos.org.au) - IMOS is a national collaborative research infrastructure supported by Australian Government. The database is a centralised acoustic telemetry data repository maintained by the IMOS Animal Tracking Facility and the Australian Ocean Data Network (AODN, https://portal.aodn.org.au/). 

To facilitate the replication of the results and analyses undertaken in the manuscript, all of the R code used for the analysis has been supplied in the primary folder of this respository. Unless stated otherwise, all of the R code contained within this respository was created by Cameron J. Baker.

All of the code has been formatted to run within the provided R project and folder layout. To complete all of the analyses contained within the manuscript, it is recommended that the R scripts be run in the numerical order that they are presented, as later scripts require the outputs from the earlier R scripts to be run. Contained within each R script is a list of all of the analyses included.

Also included is a folder named R_functions. This folder contains all of the custom R functions that were created in order to perform the analyses. Where required in the primary scripts these functions will be remotely called in. Full details of what each function requires as inputs and what they do is contained within the R script of each function.
